# Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Project 2: Digital Bookshelf

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution for project 2 of the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree. The project mandates the creation of a catalog-type web app where users will be authenticated via a third-party login provider (such as Google), and will be able to create, read, update, and delete items. This app is to be built using Python and will take advantage of a database.

Thus, to satify this requirement, I'm building a digital bookshelf where users will be able to create categories of books as well as view, add, update and delete their books.
