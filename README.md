# Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Project 2: Digital Bookshelf

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution for project 2 of the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree. The project mandates the creation of a catalog-type web app where users will be authenticated via a third-party login provider (such as Google), and will be able to create, read, update, and delete items. This app is to be built using Python and Flask using a SQLite backend.

As such, this project will take the shape of a digital bookshelf where users will be able to create categories of books as well as view, add, update and delete their books.

## Status

_In development._

## Project structure

The project is structured as a Python package with several subpackages beneath it.

* **app:** Contains the core logic of the Flask web application.
* **db:** Contains the database abstraction components.
* **tests:** Contains the unit tests.

## Setting up

TBD.
